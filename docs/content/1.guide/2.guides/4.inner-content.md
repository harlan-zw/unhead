# Tag Inner Content

For tags that set inner content, such as `<style>` and `<script>`,
you can set the inner content using the `textContent` or `innerHTML` properties.

When using `textContent` the content will have simple sanitisation applied server side. Client side it will use the
`element.textContent` setter.

⚠️ When using `innerHTML` the content will not be sanitised. Client side it will use the `element.innerHTML` setter. Make sure you sanitise user input if providing it with this property.

Note: `children` is an alias for `innerHTML` and is deprecated.

## Example

```ts
useHead({
  style: [
    {
      innerHTML: `body {color: red}`,
    },
  ],
  noscript: [
    {
      textContent: `Javascript is required`,
    },
  ],
})
```
